# Podcast Downloader

The Python module for downloading files from given RSS feeds.
It is not using database of any sort. It require configuration file.

The script is analyzing the dictionary where it put the previously downloaded files.
It is compering the last added file with the podcast feed, finding the missing, and downloading them.

As name suggested, the script is designed for podcasts. The files searched by default are mp3.

## Setup

### Installation from PyPI

```bash
pip install podcast_downloader
```

## Running the script

After installation, the script is called as Python module.

```bash
python -m podcast_downloader
```

### In action

Using the [example above](#example), the result will be:

```log

[2020-06-16 19:54:35] Checking "The Skeptic Guide"

[2020-06-16 19:54:39] Finished
```

## Configuration

### The configuration file

The configuration file is placed in home directory. The name: `.podcast_downloader_config.json`.
The format is: [JSON](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/JSON).

### The settings hierarchy

The script will replace default values by read from configuration file.
Those will be cover by all values given by command line.

### The main options

| Property             | Type      | Required | Default                  | Note |
|:---------------------|:---------:|:--------:|:------------------------:|:-----|
| `downloads_limit`    | number    | no       | infinity                 |      |
| `if_directory_empty` | string    | no       | download_last            | See [In case of empty directory](#in-case-of-empty-directory) |
| `podcast_extensions` | key-value | no       | `{".mp3": "audio/mpeg"}` | The file filter |

### Podcasts sub category

`Podcasts` is the part of configuration file where you provide the array of objects with fallowing content:

| Property             | Type      | Required | Default                  | Note |
|:---------------------|:---------:|:--------:|:------------------------:|:-----|
| `name`               | string    | yes      | -                        | The name of channel (used in logger) |
| `rss_link`           | string    | yes      | -                        | The URL of RSS channel |
| `path`               | string    | yes      | -                        | The path to directory, for podcast files |
| `require_date`       | boolean   | no       | `false`                  | Is date of podcast should be added into name of file |
| `disable`            | boolean   | no       | `false`                  | This podcast will be ignored |
| `podcast_extensions` | key-value | no       | `{".mp3": "audio/mpeg"}` | The file filter |

### An example of configuration file

```json
{
    "if_directory_empty": "download_from_4_days",
    "podcasts": [
        {
            "name": "The Skeptic Guide",
            "rss_link": "http://www.theskepticsguide.org/feed/rss.aspx",
            "path": "~/podcasts/SGTTU"
        }
    ]
}
```

## Script arguments

The script accept following command line arguments:

| Short version | Long name              | Parameter           | Default         | Note |
|:--------------|:-----------------------|:-------------------:|:---------------:|:-----|
|               | `--downloads_limit`    | number              | infinity        | The maximum number of downloaded mp3 files |
|               | `--if_directory_empty` | string              | `download_last` | The general approach on empty directory' |

## Adding date to file name

If RSS channel doesn't have single and constant name convention, it may causing the script to working incorrectly. The solution is force files to have common and meaningful prefix. The script is able to adding the date on beginning of downloaded file name.

How to turn on: set the `require_date` option to true.

## File types filter

Podcasts are mostly stored as `*.mp3` files. By default Podcast Downloader will look just for them.

If your podcast support other types of media files, you can precised your own podcast file filter, by providing extension for the file (like `.mp3`), and type of link in RSS feed itself (for `mp3` it is `audio/mpeg`).

If you don't know the type of the file, you can check the RSS file. Seek for `enclosure` tags, should looks like this:

```xml
    <enclosure
        url="https://an.apple.supporter.page/podcast/episode23.m4a"
        length="14527149"
        type="audio/x-m4a" />
```

Notes: the dot on the file extension is require.

### Example

```json
  "podcast_extensions": {
    ".mp3": "audio/mpeg",
    ".m4a": "audio/x-m4a"
  }
```

## In case of empty directory

If a directory for podcast is empty, the script needs to recognize what to do. Due to lack of database, you can:

* download only the last episode
* download all new episode from last n days

### Only last

The script will download only the last episode from the feed.
It is a good approach when you wish to start listening the podcast.
It is also default approach of the script.

Set by `download_last`.

### Download all from n days

The script will download all episodes which appear in last *n* days. I can be use when you are downloading on regular schedule.
The *n* number is given within the setup value: `download_from_n_days`. For example: `download_from_3_days` means download all episodes from last 3 days.
